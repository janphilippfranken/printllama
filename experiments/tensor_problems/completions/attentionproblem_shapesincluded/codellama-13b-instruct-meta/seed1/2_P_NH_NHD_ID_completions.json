The output tensor should have the same shape as the input tensor `V`, which is (64, 50, 48), but the intermediate tensor `scores` has a shape of (64, 50, 32) due to the matrix multiplication with `K.transpose(-2, -1)`. Therefore, the output tensor `output` has a shape of (64, 50, 32) instead of (64, 50, 48).\n\nTo correct the solution, we need to modify the `scores` tensor to have the same shape as the input tensor `V`. We can do this by adding a dimension to the `scores` tensor using the `unsqueeze` method, like this:\n```python\nscores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)).unsqueeze(-1)\n```\nThis will add a new dimension of size 1 to the `scores` tensor, making it have the same shape as the input tensor `V`.
