The output tensor should preserve the diagonal elements of M and have the same shape as M.\n\nInstructions:\nCorrect the solution to satisfy the task constraints. Do not change the name of the function or the number of arguments. Return the full corrected ```algorithm``` function.\n\nHint:\nUse the print statement to help you construct the correct solution.\n\nIncorrect Solution:\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef algorithm(M: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    '''\n    args:\n        M: torch.Tensor of shape (n, n)\n\n    return:\n        output: torch.Tensor of shape (n, n) with only main diagonal elements from M\n    '''\n    n = M.size(0)\n    mask = torch.eye(n, n)\n    print(f'mask: {mask}')  # prints 'mask: ' followed by the current mask tensor\n    output = mask + M\n    return output\n```\n"
