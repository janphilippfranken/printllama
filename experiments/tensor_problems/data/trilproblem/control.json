All the elements above the main diagonal in 'L' should be zeros. You must achieve this using PyTorch tensor operations and list comprehensions.\n\nInstructions:\nCorrect the solution to satisfy the task constraints. Do not change the name of the function or the number of arguments. Return the full corrected ```algorithm``` function.\n\nHint:\n\nIncorrect Solution:\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef algorithm(M: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    '''\n    args:\n        M: torch.Tensor of shape (N, N)\n\n    return:\n        L: torch.Tensor of shape (N, N), which is the lower triangular part of M\n    '''\n    N = M.size(0)\n    L = torch.tensor([[M[i, j] if i <= j else 0 for j in range(N)] for i in range(N)])  \n    return L\n```\n"
